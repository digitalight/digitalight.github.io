Hi everyone, I am a p5.js beginner but enjoying the videos from Dan Shiffman on [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) youtube channel.

Today I followed the tutorial by the guest presenter Emily on making a Matrix code effect.

I tweaked the code a bit so it uses the fading effect that Emily used afterward in her github version and also added numbers
into it and making sure they are centred correctly.

Here is the page [Click Here](https://digitalight.github.io/p5js-matrix/)

And the repo for this is : [https://github.com/digitalight/p5js-matrix](https://github.com/digitalight/p5js-matrix)
