With some more time on my hands. I have been doing some Ubuntu Testing after watching the youtube videos of both [Alan Pope](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNOT8x4KDYQQPUtmDsvaYA) and [Martin Wimpress](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChpYmMp7EFaxuogUX1eAqyw) and inspired to help with the [ISO QA](iso.qa.ubuntu.com).

I recommend checking out Martin Wimpress's [QuickEMU](https://github.com/wimpysworld/quickemu). Which is a cool alternative to Virtualbox and ideal for quick iso testing.

This has also started me off learning bash scripting and the project has been to automate a way of downloading the Ubuntu daily images for testing.
