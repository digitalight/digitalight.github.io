After watching one of the latest videos from Numberphile on Youtube.  
I thought, I could try making this mathematical thing in p5js.  
In the past I have had code example to work from, but this time all I had was maths.  
It was a good challenge for me as Maths is not a strong point for me and working out the code for this allowed me to learn it in more detail.

After coming up with a good working prototype. I decided to put some polish on this and use Bootstrap theme to make it look nice and also output the dice, counter and also add a slider for the user.
