Hello everyone, just a quick post this time to wish you a Happy Easter.  
And as my continuation on writing code as much as often. Here is a little p5.js sketch.

I have just finished the Nature of Code course on Kadenze and awaiting my final score.
Really enjoyed it and look forward to doing more coding.
